      <h2>Do I need to be fit to start?</h2>
      <p>Not at all! Many people worry about their age, weight, height, fitness level, or appearance—but you can leave those fears at the door. At Pussycat Poles, we believe in inclusion and creating a space where everyone feels comfortable. The only requirement is that you're at least 16 years old.</p>

      <h2>Will I have to share equipment (pole/hoop/silk)?</h2>
      <p>You may be sharing with up to one other person, depending on how busy the class is. Sharing is actually recommended—it gives your muscles a chance to rest between moves, much like taking a break between sets at the gym. Plus, sharing makes the class more sociable and fun! It’s a great way to meet new people and stay motivated.</p>

      <h2>Do I have to pay the full course fee upfront?</h2>
      <p>Nope! Our 8-week Beginner Course is £120, and you can pay in three instalments:<br>
      • £40 deposit to secure your space<br>
      • £40 in Week 3<br>
      • £40 in Week 5<br>
      If you attend your first class and decide it's not for you, there’s no pressure to continue.</p>

      <h2>What should I wear?</h2>
      <p><strong>Pole:</strong> Wear whatever you're comfortable in, but make sure your arms and legs are bare (e.g., vest, t-shirt, shorts). Bare feet or socks are fine. No jewellery, and please avoid using body moisturiser on the day.<br>
      <strong>Circus:</strong> The opposite—arms and legs should be fully covered. Again, no jewellery.</p>

      <h2>Can I come alone, or do I need a friend?</h2>
      <p>You’re welcome to come solo or with a friend! Our classes are welcoming, fun, and confidence-boosting. You'll likely make new friends either way.</p>

      <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
      <p>Just yourself and a sense of adventure! We’ll take care of the rest.</p>

      <h2>What are the benefits?</h2>
      <p>Pole and circus training is amazing for toning up, losing weight, improving flexibility, boosting confidence, and making new friends. The benefits truly are endless.</p>

      <h2>What if I miss a class?</h2>
      <p>We can't carry missed sessions over to another course, but don’t worry—we’ll do our best to catch you up in class so you don’t fall behind.</p>

      <h2>What if I’ve paid but can’t attend anymore?</h2>
      <p>We’re unable to offer refunds, exchanges, or credits. Your course spot is reserved for the specific dates and times you sign up for.<br>
      The only exception is a medical reason that prevents you from taking part—in that case, we’ll pause your course from the date you contact us until you’re cleared to return by your doctor.</p>

      <h2>Do you offer single sessions?</h2>
      <p>Yes! Drop-in sessions are £20 and must be paid at the start of the class.</p>
